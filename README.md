## Modules

Language specific functionality is provided by modules.
*codegame-cli* automatically downloads the correct module version corresponding to the CodeGame version and
executes the downloaded binary at the root of the project directory with the respective command.

Additionally, the _CONFIG_FILE_ environment variable is set with the path to a temporary file containing command specific configuration in JSON format.

Modules can be implemented in any language. However, it is recommended to write them in Go
using the `github.com/code-game-project/go-utils` and `github.com/Bananenpro/cli` packages in order to avoid bugs and be consistent with the CLI and other modules.

### new

Creates a new project of the type provided by a second command line argument:

#### client

Creates a new game client.
This includes integration with the client library for the language, a functioning template with a main file and language specific metadata files like `package.json` or similar
and wrappers around the library to make its usage easier including setting the game URL with the CG_GAME_URL environment variable (required).

##### config data

```jsonc
{
	"lang": "go", // the chosen programming language (in case one module supports multiple languages)
	"name": "my_game", // the name of the game
	"url": "my_game.example.com", // the URL of the game server
	"library_version": "0.9.2" // the version of the client library to use
}
```

#### server

Creates a new game server.
This includes integration with the server library of the language and a functioning template, which implements common logic like starting the server and providing a game class.

##### config data

```jsonc
{
	"lang": "go", // the chosen programming language (in case one module supports multiple languages)
	"library_version": "0.9.2" // the version of the server library to use
}
```

### update

Updates the library to the specified version and all other dependencies used by the project to their newest compatible version.
Additionally all wrappers are updated.

##### config data

```jsonc
{
	"lang": "go", // the chosen programming language (in case one module supports multiple languages)
	"library_version": "0.9.2" // the new version of the library to use
}

```

### run

Runs the project with the specified command line arguments and the *CG_GAME_URL*â€¯environment variable set to the URL specified in the `.codegame.json` file.

##### config data

```jsonc
{
	"lang": "go", // the chosen programming language (in case one module supports multiple languages)
	"args": ["-f", "my_file.txt"] // the command line arguments for the application
}
```

### build

Builds the projects and injects the URL specified in the `.codegame.json` file, which makes the *CG_GAME_URL* environment variable optional.

##### config data

```jsonc
{
	"lang": "go", // the chosen programming language (in case one module supports multiple languages)
	"output": "bin/my-game" // The name of the output file
}
```
